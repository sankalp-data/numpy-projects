# NumPy Projects 🚀

Welcome to my collection of Python + NumPy projects!

This repository contains a series of **beginner** to **advanced-level** projects that showcase the **power** **of** **NumPy** for numerical computing and data manipulation.

## 🔍 Purpose

As a passionate learner aiming to become a Data Scientist, this repository reflects my progress in understanding how NumPy works under the hood and how it can be applied in real-world scenarios.

Each project is designed to:
- Strengthen my Python logic and NumPy fundamentals
- Practice clean and readable code
- Document real use cases of arrays, matrix operations, broadcasting, and vectorization

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- Array creation, slicing, reshaping
- Broadcasting and vectorized operations
- Mathematical and statistical functions
- Random data generation
- Simulation-based problem solving
- Data manipulation using NumPy

## 📁 Projects Included

 - Student Report Generator


## 🛠 Tech Stack
- *Language*: Python 3.x
- *Library*: NumPy (Basic to Advanced Level)


## 💡 Personal Note
