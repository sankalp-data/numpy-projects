# 🎓 Student Report Generator (In Progress)

This is a basic Python-based **Student Report Generator** that allows users to:

- Input student name and roll number
- Enter marks for multiple subjects
- Automatically store and structure student performance

## 🚀 Features

- Clean class-based OOP design
- Input validation for subject marks
- Modular and easy to extend
- (Coming Soon) JSON-based data saving/loading
- (Planned) Performance summary & grading logic using NumPy

## ⚒️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- JSON

## 📌 Why This Project?

I’m currently learning Python and exploring OOP and NumPy together. This project is:
- A learning experiment in **object-oriented design**
- A foundation for more advanced **student performance analytics**
- A step toward working with **data persistence (file handling)**

## ⏳ Project Status

This project is **in active development** and will be gradually upgraded with:
- Data saving/loading (JSON)
- Summary statistics (mean, grade, etc.)
- Better CLI interface
- Exception handling improvements

## 🙌 Contribution

This is a solo learning project, but suggestions and feedback are welcome!

## 🧠 Future Enhancements

- Grade calculation
- Store multiple students
- Export reports to file
- CLI or GUI interface
